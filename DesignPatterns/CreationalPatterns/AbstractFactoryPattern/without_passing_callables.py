# f we prohibit our Python code from passing callables, then we eliminate verbs
#  from the arguments we can pass. Instead we will always pass nouns, and any
# verb we want to accomplish will have to dangle off of a noun as a method.
# Instead of a simple function, weâ€™ll need to indent our code an extra level and
#  wrap it up inside a class.
