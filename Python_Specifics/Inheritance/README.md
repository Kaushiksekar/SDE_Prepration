(iii)Method overloading is not possible in python, although it can be simulated-
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-method-overloading/

(iv) Python is implicitly polymorphic-
https://www.python-course.eu/python3_multiple_inheritance.php

(v) Static method does receive an implicit argument-
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/class-method-vs-static-method-python/

(vi) A class method receives the class as implicit first argument, just like an
instance method receives the instance-
